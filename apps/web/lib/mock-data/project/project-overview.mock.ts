	overview:
		'Qnetic is developing a revolutionary mechanical battery technology that stores energy through kinetic motion rather than chemical reactions. Our patented flywheel-based system achieves energy densities comparable to lithium-ion batteries but with zero degradation over time, unlimited charge cycles, and no rare earth materials or toxic chemicals.',
	descriptionTitle: 'Project Description',
	descriptionParagraphs: [
		"At Qnetic, we're addressing one of the most critical challenges in the renewable energy transition: efficient, sustainable energy storage. Our innovative mechanical battery technology represents a paradigm shift in how we think about storing and deploying energy.",
		"The core of our technology is a high-performance flywheel system that stores energy kinetically rather than chemically. By using advanced composite materials and magnetic bearings, we've created a system that achieves energy densities comparable to lithium-ion batteries but without the environmental drawbacks or performance degradation.",
