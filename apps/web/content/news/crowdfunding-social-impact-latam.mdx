Crowdfunding is one of the fastest ways to fund real-world impact across Latin America—but donors need **clarity, proof, and progress**.  
This guide outlines how projects can run **transparent, milestone-based campaigns** on KindFi to earn trust and convert supporters into long-term backers.

## Why LATAM projects struggle with traditional crowdfunding

- **High friction and fees** for international payments.
- **Low donor confidence** due to vague outcomes and limited reporting.
- **One-off campaigns** that don’t build a repeatable funding engine.

<Callout type="info" title="The KindFi approach">
  KindFi uses **milestone-based escrow on Stellar** (via Trustless Work) so
  funds are released when specific milestones are verified. Donors see **what
  was promised**, **what was delivered**, and **when funds moved**.
</Callout>

## What donors actually want to see

- A **clear problem statement** and who benefits.
- **Specific milestones** with costs and timelines.
- **On-chain or verifiable references** when funds are released.
- **Photos, receipts, and short updates** proving delivery.

## How to structure a LATAM-ready campaign

### 1) Define milestones with budgets

Break your goal into 2–5 milestones. Each milestone should have a deliverable, target date, and budget.

| Milestone     | Deliverable                             | Cost (USD) | Target Date | Proof                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------: | ----------: | ----------------------------- |
| Water filters | Install 50 family filters in Puntarenas |      3,250 |  2025-10-15 | Photos, beneficiary list, GPS |
| Training      | Hygiene workshops for 50 families       |        600 |  2025-10-20 | Attendance sheets             |
| Audit         | Independent verification & report       |        350 |  2025-10-25 | PDF report                    |

### 2) Publish a short, outcome-focused story

Lead with the **benefit**, not the tool.  
“50 families get clean water for under $70 each” beats “We’re raising money for equipment.”

### 3) Add transparent release criteria

State how you’ll prove completion (e.g., receipts, photos, reports, on-chain reference). Use the **Updates** tab to show progress.

### 4) Use media that travels well

- 1 cover image (1200×630) and 2–5 progress photos.
- Short video (≤30s) for social.
- Captions that mention **city, country, and outcome**.

<Callout type="success" title="Copy-and-paste CTA for your socials">
  “Help us fund clean water for 50 families in Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Every
  tranche is released on milestone completion, verified on-chain. Read the plan
  and follow updates on KindFi: /projects”
</Callout>

## Categories that perform well in LATAM

- **Clean water** and sanitation
- **Education** (equipment, connectivity, scholarships)
- **Disaster relief** (rapid deployments)
- **Animal rescue** and welfare
- **Health access** (clinics, screenings, supplies)
- **Community development** (lighting, parks, safety)

## Your 7-day launch checklist

- [ ] Write a **150–200 word** campaign overview with the outcome in the first sentence.
- [ ] Define **2–5 milestones** with costs and proof.
- [ ] Prepare **1 cover** + **3 progress photos**.
- [ ] Publish your campaign on KindFi and add the **first update** (what’s next, when, and how you’ll verify).
- [ ] Share the campaign link with a **city/country hashtag** for local discovery.
- [ ] Schedule **weekly updates** (even if short) until all milestones are complete.

## Why projects choose KindFi

- **Milestone-based escrow** builds trust and increases completion rates.
- **Friction-light cross-border** funding on Stellar.
- **Built-in updates** and shareable previews for X, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp.
- **Project pages** that grow with your results, not just one campaign.
