We’re excited to share that **KindFi is attending Meridian 2025**—Stellar’s flagship conference—taking place **September 17–18, 2025 at the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**. The theme this year is **“The Blueprint”**, bringing together builders, founders, policymakers, and ecosystem partners focused on real-world finance and open blockchain innovation.

<Callout type="info" title="Heading to Rio? Let’s connect">
  If you’re building around **escrow, stablecoins, real-world impact, or
  transparent crowdfunding**, we’d love to meet. We’ll be on site both
  conference days and during the hackathon window.
</Callout>

## Who’s traveling with us

We’re proud to highlight fellow Costa Rica projects from the **Trustless Work** ecosystem who will also be in the mix:

- **Trustless Work** — Stellar-based **escrow infrastructure** powering milestone-based, non-custodial payments.
- **GrantFox** — Open-source **grants & milestone payouts** platform using Trustless Work smart escrows.
- **Pacto** — Local P2P trading and on/off-ramps where every trade is secured with **Trustless Work escrows**.

These tools help us make **transparent, verifiable crowdfunding** possible across LATAM—exactly the kind of practical innovation Meridian celebrates.

## Why Meridian matters for KindFi

- **Real partnerships, faster shipping**: Two days of workshops, technical talks, and founder-to-founder conversations designed to move products from zero to one.
- **HackMeridian**: Ahead of the main event, the official hackathon (Sept 15–16) is a great space to prototype integrations and form teams.
- **Focus areas we care about**: stablecoins, tokenization, DeFi, compliance, smart contracts, payments, and interoperability—core to how we run escrow-first crowdfunding.

## Find us in Rio

- **Dates**: Sept 17–18 (main conference)
- **Venue**: Copacabana Palace, Rio de Janeiro
- **Pre-events**: HackMeridian (Sept 15–16)

Want to meet? Send us a note via **/contact**, or ping us on X/LinkedIn. If you’re a project operating in **education, clean water, disaster relief, animal welfare, or community development** and want **milestone-based funding** with on-chain references, come talk to us.

<Callout type="success" title="Let’s collaborate">
  Running a Stellar-powered product and want to add **milestone escrows** or
  **verifiable updates** to your funding flow? We’ll be happy to whiteboard
  ideas at the venue.
</Callout>

See you in Rio.
