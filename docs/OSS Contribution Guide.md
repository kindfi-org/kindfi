Welcome to KindFi! We're thrilled to have you join us on this exciting journey of innovation and collaboration. This guide will be your compass as you navigate the rewarding process of contributing to our cutting-edge projects at the forefront of AI and Web3 technologies.

## Introduction

Our OSS Organization is on a mission to revolutionize the 4th Industrial Revolution by pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI and Web3. As a contributor, you'll be joining a passionate, global community united by the vision of building a decentralized future where open-source AI organizations can flourish. üöÄ üéâ

Your contributions, no matter how big or small, will play a crucial role in shaping this exciting future. We can't wait to see the innovative ideas and unique perspectives you'll bring to our projects! üòè

## Code Contribution: Review Process

### Automated Reviews

Our trusty AI sidekick, [CodeRabbitAI](https://www.coderabbit.ai/), will be the first to review your code, checking for style consistency, potential bugs, and performance improvements. It will suggest code and provide sometimes critical thinking, these can make more sense if we teach it the logic behind by starting a conversation with CodeRabbitAi.

### Human Reviews

Once the AI review is complete or under review, a project lead will take a closer look at your changes, evaluating the design, architecture, and overall fit within the project's goals. Making also conversations with CodeRabbitAi to dive deeper into details with the codebase. Project lead may or may not close any open feedback given by the AI.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If project lead notices that the AI feedback is not accurate, they will start a conversation with CodeRabbitAi to improve the AI feedback and, as contributor, you can do the same. Additionally, if project lead notice that commits are not signed, it will be rejected and ask to re-upload the commits with the proper signature.

### Addressing Feedback

When you receive feedback on your changes:

1. Take the time to thoroughly understand the suggestions and ask for clarification if needed.
2. Implement the requested changes in your code with care and precision.
3. Commit the revisions and push them to your branch. Make sure they are signed.
4. Notify the reviewers that you've addressed their feedback and your code is ready for another round of review.

If your changes are approved, they'll be merged into the main project. If further iteration is needed, use the provided feedback as a guide to refine your work and resubmit.

## Design Contribution: Review Process

Our design workflow is built around Figma as our primary design tool. Here's our comprehensive contribution process. Similar to our code review process, design contributions follow a structured workflow through GitHub and Figma:

### Design Review Workflow

1. Create designs in the designated Figma workspace.
2. Follow our naming conventions and organization structure.
3. Request review by tagging project leads in both GitHub and Figma.
4. Address feedback through Figma comments while keeping the GitHub issue updated. Use this [GitHub plugin from Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1220512233196109878/github) to link them efficiently.
5. Continue iteration until a project lead approves the design.

### Quality Requirements

Project leads verify these essential elements:

- Alignment with design system guidelines.
- Implementation of proper layout and constraints.
- Component reusability and modularity.
- Accessibility compliance.
- Responsive design implementation.

## Issue Application Template

[**Issue Application Template**](OSS%20Contribution%20Guide%2015f8754a4a4b80709015ed37649d6058/Issue%20Application%20Template%201758754a4a4b80b18556d7d2ba79dbc0.md)

## Issue Reporting

If you encounter a code bug or have a brilliant idea for a new feature, don't hesitate to raise an issue:

1. Search the existing issues to ensure you're not duplicating a known concern.
2. Choose a clear, descriptive title that encapsulates the core of the issue.
3. Provide a detailed description, including steps to reproduce bugs or use cases for features.
4. Apply relevant labels (e.g., "bug", "enhancement") to help categorize the issue. Ask admins to verify the labels.
5. Maintain a respectful and understanding tone in your communications.

For design issue reporting, we maintain a clear connection between GitHub and Figma:

1. Create a GitHub issue with comprehensive Figma design references.
2. Include links to specific Figma frames and components.
3. Conduct design discussions and feedback in Figma, linking relevant discussions in the GitHub issue.
4. Keep Figma comments open until the issue is resolved.
5. After resolution, close Figma comments while preserving them for future reference.

## Continuous Contribution

At KindFi, we value long-term commitment and sustained contributions to our projects. We understand that meaningful development extends beyond hackathons and community events from OnlyDust contributors.

For contributors who maintain consistent involvement between hackathons and throughout different stages of KindFi's development, we offer enhanced budget allocations. This means:

- Increased funding for your projects at the conclusion of hackathon events.
- Additional resources allocated based on your sustained contribution history.
- Special budget considerations during key development stages.

This incentive structure is designed to:

1. Encourage continuous engagement with our projects.
2. Reward dedication and persistent involvement.
3. Support long-term development goals.

Remember, consistent contribution doesn't just mean code commits - it includes documentation updates, community support, and project maintenance. All these aspects are valued and considered in our budget allocation process.

## Community and Support

We believe that a thriving community is the heart and soul of any successful open-source project. Here's how we cultivate a welcoming and supportive environment:

- Communication channels in Telegram where you can connect with fellow contributors, ask questions, and share ideas.
- The GitHub issue tracker, a hub for lively discussions, brainstorming sessions, and collaborative problem-solving.
- Clear contribution guidelines and a code of conduct that ensure everyone feels respected and valued.
- Recognition and celebration of individual contributions, acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our community members.

Building a strong, inclusive community requires consistent effort and commitment from every one of us. By fostering an atmosphere of openness, empathy, and mutual support, we can achieve incredible things together.
