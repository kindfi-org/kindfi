### :open\_file\_folder: Folder Structure

Our monorepo, managed with the lightning-fast `bun` package manager, follows an intuitive and declarative folder structure:

1. `apps/`: The home for your groundbreaking server and web applications
2. `packages/`: A treasure trove of reusable packages that your apps and services can leverage
3. `services/`: The hub for integrating powerful third-party services like Supabase and DatoCMS
4. `docs/`: The knowledge base where we store enlightening markdown documents, from product updates to architectural decisions

The beauty of this structure lies in its modularity and flexibility:

* Services can seamlessly integrate packages to supercharge their functionality
* Apps can tap into the power of both packages and services to create incredible experiences
* Packages act as the building blocks, independent of specific apps or services
* Docs serve as the source of truth, generating comprehensive external documentation
