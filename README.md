## 🚀 Quick Start

### BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

> **Mac/Linux Users:** Follow the [Taskfile.yml](./Taskfile.yml) for the full list of commands to run the project in different areas. Each command has a description of what it does.

> 👀 To make Biome work with auto-formatting, make sure to have `Biome` as the **default code formatter**. You can find the configuration with the command `CTRL + ,` or `CMD + ,` for MacOS users and search for the `vscode://settings/editor.defaultFormatter`. This will read the monorepo Biome configuration. Make sure to have the [Biome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) in your IDE before doing any installation.

1. To install all dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
bun run init # bun install && bun husky:prepare
```

> Biome and pre-commit hooks should be installed by now. Ready to run!

1. To run:

```bash
# web app
cd apps/web
bun dev

# kyc-server

You can see the full list of commands in each of the `package.json` files in the `apps` and `services` directories.
