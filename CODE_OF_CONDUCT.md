## Code Quality & Contribution Standards

As a community focused on technical excellence, we maintain high standards for code contributions:

### Code Style Requirements

All contributors must adhere to our comprehensive code style guide. Key requirements include:

- **TypeScript Best Practices**: Leverage type safety, avoid `any`, use appropriate `interface` vs `type` declarations.
- **React Conventions**: Write declarative, functional components following hooks patterns and composition principles.
- **Modern JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features, meaningful naming conventions, and RORO (Receive Object, Return Object) patterns.
- **File Organization**: Follow our lowercase-with-dashes naming convention and appropriate file extensions (`.config.ts`, `.test.ts`, `.hook.ts`, etc.).
- **No Default Exports**: Prefer named exports for better tree-shaking and import clarity.

### Contribution Process

1. **Code Review**: All contributions undergo automated review by CodeRabbitAI followed by human review from project leads.
2. **Signed Commits**: All commits must be signed for security and authenticity.
3. **Branch Naming**: Follow our convention: `feat-123-feature-name`, `fix-456-bug-description`, etc.
4. **Documentation**: Include appropriate JSDoc comments and update relevant documentation.
5. **Testing**: Ensure code coverage meets project standards with proper unit and integration tests.

### Git Conventions

- **Commit Messages**: Use lowercase, descriptive messages under 72 characters.
- **Branch Workflow**: Create feature branches from `develop`, rebase regularly, and follow our branching model.
- **Monorepo Awareness**: Clearly indicate which part of the project your changes affect.

## Community Engagement

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and technical discussions.
